SCIENTIFIC
METHOD

SCIENTIFIC METHOD
DEFINITION
• Empirical method for acquiring knowledge in science fields

• Emerged in the 17th century
• Involves careful observations with rigorous skepticism
• Can be biased by cognitive assumptions
• Formulation and test of hypotheses is key

SCIENTIFIC METHOD
BRIEF HISTORY
• Ancient Egypt : Edwin Smith papyrus (~1600 BCE) :
Egyptian medical textbook with first signs of empirical
methodology : examination, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis
• Classical antiquity :
THALES (626/623 – 548/545 BCE) : first philosopher to use natural
explanations.

ARISTOTLE (384 – 322 BCE) : founder of Modern Science with the
Aristotelianism movement : deductive logic, analytic inductive method.

SCIENTIFIC METHOD
BRIEF HISTORY
• Middle Ages :

Ibn AL-HAYTHAM (965 - 1040) : Persian mathematician, astronomer and
physicist considered as the father of modern optics

Francis BACON (1561 – 1626) : English philosopher, father of
empiricism (evidence finding through experiments).

René DESCARTES (1596 – 1650) : father of modern philosophy and
rationalism (“reason has precedence over other ways of acquiring
knowledge : faith, sensory experience or tradition”)

CLINICAL
TRIALS

CLINICAL TRIALS
DEFINITION
• Prospective biomedical or behavioral research study on human participants
designed to answer specific question about biomedical or behavioral
interventions
• Application domains : treatments (vaccines, drugs, chirurgy…),
dietary supplements, medical devices

• Strictly controlled, monitored and evaluated by international (FDA in the USA,
EMEA in Europe) and national health authorities (ANSM in France).

CLINICAL TRIALS
BRIEF HISTORY
Medical experiments exists from Antiquity but without any control group

The first clinical trial was managed in 1747 by James LIND (1716 – 1794) :
study of effect of various dietary supplements on scorbutic sailors during
2 months on a boat.
Scurvy : deficiency disease very common during long sailing travels.
Symptoms : weakness, fatigue, decreased red blood cells,
skin bleeding, poor wound healing and death from infection

14

CLINICAL TRIALS
BRIEF HISTORY
Assumption to test : citrus fruit consumption is protective from
scurvy (vitamin-C effect) : John WOODALL (1570 – 1643),
surgeon of British East India Company
12 sailors divided into 6 groups of 2 with different supplements :
1. Cider
2. Sulfuric acid
3. Vinegar
4. Seawater (control group)
5. Oranges + lemon
6. Spicy paste + barley water
Only patients in group 5 quickly recovered from scurvy.

CLINICAL TRIALS
BRIEF HISTORY
John HAYGARTH (1740 – 1827) : English physician who demonstrated
the importance of control group for the correct identification of
placebo effect in smallpox studies.
Ronald A. FISHER (1890 – 1962) : English statistician who proved
the benefits of randomization, replication and blocks in clinical trials
Austin BRADFORD HILL (1897 – 1991) : English epidemiologist who
pioneered the randomized clinical trials (first proved link between
cigarette smoking and lung cancer)

CLINICAL TRIALS
BIAS
• Selection bias : systematic differences between baseline characteristics of the
groups that are compared. Randomization helps to control it.

• Performance bias : systematic differences between groups in the care that is
provided, or in exposure to factors other than the interventions of interest.
Blinding of treatment allocation helps to control it.
• Attrition bias : systematic differences between groups in withdrawals from a
study (missing values).
• Reporting bias : systematic differences between reported and unreported
findings.

CLINICAL TRIALS
RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL (RCT)
• Clinical trial with the highest level of evidence
(Gold Standard
in medical research)

• Often with two-parallel groups studied during
the same period of time (longitudinal study)
• Patients are allocated randomly to a group,
in order to have balanced groups (same
characteristics)

• Often two groups
➢ Controlled : placebo or standard of care
➢ New treatment

CLINICAL TRIALS
RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL – THREE POPULATIONS

OCTOBER 2025 / JUNIA ISEN / BIOSTATISTICS COURSE #5 / CLINICAL TRIALS

25

CLINICAL TRIALS
RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL – PARALLEL TRIAL

Advantages
Can be applied to almost any disease.

Disadvantages
In multiple treatment groups statistics may become challenging.

Any number of groups can be run simultaneously.

Groups can be in separate locations.

OCTOBER 2025 / JUNIA ISEN / BIOSTATISTICS COURSE #5 / CLINICAL TRIALS

26

CLINICAL TRIALS
RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL – CROSS-OVER TRIAL

Advantages

Disadvantages

Low variance due to participant and control being the same. Requires a long-term illness as treatments are applied one after
the other.
Can include several treatments.

Carry over effects need to be avoided (washout period must be
sufficiently long).

Groups can be in separate locations.
OCTOBER 2025 / JUNIA ISEN / BIOSTATISTICS COURSE #5 / CLINICAL TRIALS

27

CLINICAL TRIALS
RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL – MATCHED-PAIR TRIAL

Advantages
Less variability found in results, and it can be applied to
most diseases.

Disadvantages
Based on similarity within the selected groups, the researcher
needs awareness of factors that could influence results
(confounding variables).

DOCUMENTS

CLINICAL DOCUMENTS
GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE
• In 1945, the world discovered Nazi’s concentration camps and inhuman
“medical” experiments performed there.The Doctors’ trial in Nuremberg in 1947
condemned Nazi doctors to long prison
(10 years to life imprisonment) or death sentences
• International medical community decided to standardize
medical trials, particularly the “ethical” side.
• The Declaration of Helsinki in 1964 stated Good Clinical Practices (GCP), an
international quality standard for clinical trials on humans.
• GCP aims to protect human rights for the subjects and volunteers in a clinical
trial.
